"""CC Packer - Creation Club Content Merger

This module provides the core functionality for merging Fallout 4 Creation Club content
into optimized archive files. It handles:

- Validation of CC content integrity (checking for complete plugin + BA2 sets)
- Extraction of individual CC archives using BSArch
- Intelligent separation of content types (general, textures, sounds, strings)
- Repacking into optimized merged archives with appropriate compression
- Smart texture splitting to respect game engine limits
- Backup creation and restoration
- Plugin file management (ESL creation and plugins.txt updates)

The merger uses BSArch.exe (bundled with the application) for all BA2 archive
operations and provides comprehensive error handling and progress reporting.

Key Features:
- Content validation to detect incomplete/orphaned CC items
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned content
- Compressed repacking for general content
- Uncompressed repacking for sound files
- Smart texture splitting with vanilla-style naming
- Preservation of STRINGS files as loose files
- Complete backup system with timestamp-based versioning

    BSArchError: Custom exception for BSArch operation failures
    CCMerger: Main class that orchestrates all merge/restore operations

    This class provides all functionality needed to:
    - Validate CC content integrity (plugin files + BA2 archives)
    - Detect and handle orphaned/incomplete CC items
    - Merge individual CC archives into optimized combined archives
    - Restore previously backed-up CC content
    - Manage plugin files and game configuration
    
    The merger uses BSArch.exe for all BA2 operations and implements intelligent
    content separation:
    - General content (meshes, scripts, etc.) -> Compressed BA2
    - Textures -> Compressed BA2, split at 7GB to avoid game engine limits
    - Sounds -> Uncompressed BA2 for compatibility
    - STRINGS -> Loose files in Data/Strings (required by game engine)
    
    Merged archives are named with the "CCPacked" prefix (changed from "CCMerged"
    in v2.0) to distinguish them from original CC content. Each archive gets its own
    corresponding ESL file with a matching prefix to ensure the game loads it correctly.
    The merger automatically cleans up legacy v1.x CCMerged files during operations.

    def merge_cc_content(self, fo4_path: str, progress_callback: Callable[[str], None]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Main merge operation - combines Creation Club archives into optimized merged archives.
        
        This is the core method that orchestrates the complete merge process:
        
        1. **Validation**: Validates CC content integrity by checking that each plugin
           has both Main and Textures BA2 files
        2. **Cleanup**: Removes old CCPacked files from previous merges
        3. **Backup**: Creates timestamped backup of all original CC files
        4. **Extraction**: Extracts all CC archives to temporary directories
        5. **Content Separation**: 
           - STRINGS files -> Moved to Data/Strings as loose files (required by game)
           - Sound files (.xwm, .wav, .fuz, .lip) -> Separated for uncompressed packing
           - Textures (.dds) -> Kept separate for DX10 archive type
           - General content -> Everything else
        6. **Repacking**:
           - Sounds: Uncompressed General BA2 (for compatibility)
           - Main: Compressed General BA2 (meshes, scripts, etc.)
           - Textures: Compressed DX10 BA2(s), split at 7GB to respect game limits
        7. **Plugin Creation**: Creates minimal ESL files for each merged archive
        8. **Game Configuration**: Updates plugins.txt to enable the ESL files
        9. **Cleanup**: Deletes original CC files and temporary directories
        
        Archive Naming Convention (v2.0+):
        - CCPacked_Sounds.esl + CCPacked_Sounds - Main.ba2 (if sound files exist)
        - CCPacked_Main.esl + CCPacked_Main - Main.ba2 (general content)
        - CCPacked_Main_Textures1.esl + CCPacked_Main_Textures1 - Textures.ba2 (first texture batch)
        - CCPacked_Main_Textures2.esl + CCPacked_Main_Textures2 - Textures.ba2 (second batch, if needed)
        - etc.
        
        Legacy v1.x naming used CCMerged prefix, which is cleaned up during merge/restore
        to support seamless upgrades.
        
        Performance Benefits:
        - Reduces plugin count from potentially dozens to 2-5 plugins
        - Improves load times by consolidating archives
        - Reduces game startup time and memory usage
        - Maintains full compatibility with all CC content
