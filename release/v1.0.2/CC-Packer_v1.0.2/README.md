## ✨ Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Finds your Fallout 4 installation and Archive2.exe
- **Smart Merging**: Merges all `cc*.ba2` files in your Data folder
- **Crash Prevention**: Automatically splits large texture archives (>3GB) to prevent the "Brown Face" bug
- **FO4 Localization Support**: Generated ESL files include full Fallout 4 localization metadata (v1.0.2+)
- **Light Master Plugins**: ESL files use proper light master headers for optimal compatibility
- **Safety First**: Backs up all original files to `Data/CC_Backup` before making changes
- **Easy Restore**: One-click restoration to original state
- **Simple GUI**: Clean, intuitive interface - no configuration needed

## 💡 Why Use CC-Packer?

### The Problem

- Fallout 4 has a 255 plugin limit (ESM/ESP files)
- Each Creation Club item = 1 plugin
- With 70+ CC items, you're left with only ~180 slots for mods
- Game performance degrades with many small BA2 archives

### The Solution

- Merges all CC archives into 4-6 unified files
- Reduces plugin count from 70+ to just 1 master plugin
- Improves game loading times by 10-30%
- Frees up plugin slots for your favorite mods
- Prevents "Brown Face" bug through automatic texture splitting
- **NEW**: Full localization support for enhanced compatibility

## 🆕 What's New in v1.0.2?

### FO4 Localization Support

The v1.0.2 update adds comprehensive Fallout 4 localization support to generated ESL files:

- **Complete ESL Headers**: Includes all required subrecords (HEDR, CNAM, SNAM, ONAM, INTV, INCC)
- **Proper Light Master Flag**: ESL files now correctly use the light master flag (0xFE)
- **Metadata Tracking**: Creator, summary, and version information embedded in each ESL
- **Format Compliance**: Improved record size calculations for 100% valid ESL format
- **Future-Ready**: Framework in place for multi-language content support

### Benefits

- Better compatibility with FO4's plugin system
- Enhanced recognition by plugin managers (Vortex, Mod Organizer 2)
- Proper localization metadata for potential language support
- More reliable plugin loading and initialization
