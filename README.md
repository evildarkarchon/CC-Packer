## 💡 Why Use CC-Packer?

### The Problem

- Fallout 4 has a 255 plugin limit (ESM/ESP files)
- Each Creation Club item = 1 plugin slot
- With 170+ CC items now available, you could lose over half your plugin slots!
- Game performance degrades with hundreds of small BA2 archives (346+ files)

### The Solution

- Merges all CC archives into just 3-4 unified files
- Reduces plugin count from 170+ to just 2-3 light master plugins
- Improves game loading times significantly
- Frees up plugin slots for your favorite mods
- Prevents "Brown Face" bug through automatic texture splitting
- **NEW**: Full localization support for enhanced compatibility
- **STRINGS Generation**: Automatic extraction and merging of localized text

## 🆕 What's New in v3.0.0

### Content Integrity & Validation

- **Orphaned Content Detection**: Validates Creation Club content before merging by checking that each CC plugin has both required BA2 archives
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Offers to automatically delete incomplete/orphaned CC downloads before merging
- **Detailed Warnings**: Clear explanations when CC content is missing files

### Improved Detection

- **Plugin-First Scanning**: More accurate detection of creation club items
- **Mixed Content Handling**: Option to automatically restore and repack when adding new CC content after a previous merge

### Developer-Friendly

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Full API documentation throughout codebase for easier contributions and modifications

## Previous Version Highlights (v2.0)

### Fully Standalone Operation

- **No More Archive2**: CC-Packer bundles bsarch.exe - no Creation Kit required!
- **Registry Detection**: Automatically finds Fallout 4 via Windows Registry
- **Simplified UI**: Removed Archive2 path field
- **New Output Names**: Merged archives named `CCPacked*` instead of `CCMerged*`

### Previous Features (v1.x)

- **Loose STRINGS Extraction**: STRINGS files extracted to `Data/Strings` as loose files
- **Separate Audio Archive**: Sound files packed uncompressed to prevent audio corruption
- **Vanilla-Style Naming**: Texture archives use numbered naming like vanilla
- **Merged File Detection**: Prevents accidental re-merging
- **Individual ESL per Texture Archive**: Each split texture archive gets its own ESL
